# Home-Assistant-Integration-Wiki
This contains documentations to integrate IoT devices to HA.

I made this repo because, when I try to integrate my Portronics Smart Plug (a 16A plug called 'SPlug') into HA and I failed to find a well explained instruction on it. 

This repo will contain instructions to integrate several IoT devices that <br>I</br> have used (fun facts: I haven't used that much) that are available in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (mainly). 

I hope that this will help someone. And I'll make sure to keep it precise and short as possible.
